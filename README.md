Welcome to the **Hands-On Computer Vision Series**, a step-by-step practical guide designed to help students **learn computer vision by building models from scratch** - one notebook at a time.

This repository provides clean, beginner-friendly **Jupyter notebooks** that walk you through key machine learning and computer vision concepts using real datasets and visual feedback.

Each notebook focuses on a single core concept - from building your first neural network to progressively enhancing it with modern deep learning techniques.

> *"The field of machine vision is swiftly evolving"* - From traditional rule-based approaches to cutting-edge deep learning architectures
