# 🔬 Hands-On Computer Vision Series: A Practical Learning Journey

Welcome to the **Hands-On Computer Vision Series**, a step-by-step practical guide designed to help students **learn computer vision by building models from scratch** — one notebook at a time.

This repository provides clean, beginner-friendly **Jupyter notebooks** that walk you through key machine learning and computer vision concepts using real datasets and visual feedback.

> 🌱 Ideal for students, educators, and self-learners who want more than theory — this is **learning by doing**.

## 🧩 Learning Approach

Each notebook includes:

- ✅ **Step-by-step explanations** for every line of code  
- 🧠 **Clear visualizations** of learning progress  
- 🧪 **Interactive code** you can modify to explore outcomes  
- 📚 **Conceptual deep dives** into activation functions, loss functions, learning rate, and more  
- 🔁 Encouragement to experiment with **hyperparameters** to boost understanding

## 📂 Dataset Information

We use the popular **Flower Classification Dataset** from Google Cloud:

- 🌼 Five flower classes: Daisy, Dandelion, Roses, Sunflowers, Tulips  
- 📄 CSV files contain image paths and labels  
- 📦 To run locally:
  1. [Download the dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz)
  2. Extract the archive
  3. Update dataset and CSV paths inside the notebook
