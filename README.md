Welcome to the **Hands-On Computer Vision Series**, a step-by-step practical guide designed to help students **learn computer vision by building models from scratch** - one notebook at a time.

This repository provides clean, beginner-friendly **Jupyter notebooks** that walk you through key machine learning and computer vision concepts using real datasets and visual feedback.

Each notebook focuses on a single core concept - from building your first neural network to progressively enhancing it with modern deep learning techniques.

> *"Master computer vision through progressive hands-on examples and real-world applications"* - Build your expertise step-by-step with practical notebooks and clear explanations.

**By Dr. Zaid Al-Huda**
